# React Sample

I have created single page application so when we click on any product, it will render item details. Now if we reload it, it will call same api from server itself though we don't have 404 error.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
